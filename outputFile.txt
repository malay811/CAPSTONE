        The "SPELL CHECKER" is a powerful tool!! that finds and fixes misspelled words in any text document you give it. It uses smart 
techniques like hash tables or trie to store and search through words quickly. This means it can check your document's spelling 
mistakes fast.


How does our 'spell checker' works?

    Our spell checker program works for text file. It takes the words one by one from the input file named "inputFile.txt" and highlight
the misspelled word and gives the suggestions for the misspelled word. User have to enter the corresponding number to correct word from
the suggestions list to change the highlighted word. if user doesn't want to change the highlighted word then enter 0 to skip that 
word. If user doesn't find correct word in suggestion list then enter -1 for more suggestions then repeat the same process as mentioned
above until you find the correct word for the misspelled word. Do the same process with all highlighted words.
(User can check the output in "outputFile.txt" file...)
